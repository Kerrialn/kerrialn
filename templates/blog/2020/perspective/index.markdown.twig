On occasion when in a state of prospection, generally after an over indulgence of wine the night before, I feel rather
disheartened at our potential future. Seemingly, we can see the fabric of the very governing framework coming undone.

“An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people” - Thomas Jefferson

Principally, an informed population is required for democracy to survive and there seems to be a precarious balance
between uninformed, informed and over informed.

Like an octogenarian’s liver, democracy is failing. Due to an over informed population that cannot differentiate between
fact and opinion. Nor can we differentiate between genuinity and thinly masked self-interest.

Nothing new there and frankly this should be no surprise, it was bound to happen. The concept is ingrained in our very
system of governance. Equality has been and continues to be the endeavor of many groups. The predication that all men,
women and anything in between are created equally is, I think we can all agree, a fantastic and unquestionable idea.

However, the gross conflation of equality and validity is our undoing. We are all equal, but our opinions are not and
nor are they equally valid.

For that matter the reverse is also true, not all problems are equal and therefore not deserving of as much of our
attention. That being the crux of the issue, our attention has been disproportionately swayed on to undeserving issues.

Attention has become the new commodity. With it you hold power to sway opinion, opinion being monetizable by commerce.
Therefore, with a lack of facts and opinions that look the same, the objective becomes rather easy to convince people
that the world is flat, drinking urine cures a virus and global warming is a hoax.

So democracy is failing because we are over informed monkeys with opinions presented as facts and because all opinions
are equal and by extension all voices have the same validity. Basically meaning, no one knows what the fuck is going on.

We are never going to eradicate badly reasoned opinions with little supporting evidence. Therefore, we must take all of
this with a few billion pinches of salt and dare I say a sense of humour. Perhaps the film Idiocracy was more prediction
than entertainment. Oh the irony, we have all the technology and knowledge now to do unbelievable things and build a
futuristic utopia of peace, but we were too distracted watching cat videos and tweeting utter nonsense on twitter.

I call on the goodwill of all people, understand that your attention is power and/or money for those that have it. Can
you justify to yourself why they deserve it?
